# Charity Sale Angular Ecommerce App

Angular 15.x

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
https://github.com/codertube/angular-ecommerce.git
cd angular-ecommerce
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs express server on port 4200.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode" proxying to back-end tomcat server running at port 8080.
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
* `npm run watch` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.

Access the application by hitting http://localhost:4200/
